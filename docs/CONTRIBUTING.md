## General Contribution Flow

### Contributing Guidelines

Firstly, thank you for considering contributing to Pieces Open Source. This guide details the general information that one should know before contributing to the repository.
Please stick as closely as possible to the guidelines. That way, we ensure that you have a smooth experience contributing to this project.

### General Rules:

These are, in general, rules that you should be following while contributing to an Open-Source Pieces project:

- Be Nice, Be Respectful (BNBR)
- Check if the Issue you created already exists or not
- When creating a new issue, make sure you describe the issue clearly
- Use tags to mark your issue as “draft” (we will remove the draft tag once we assign the proper issue tags to the created issue)
- Make proper commit messages and document your PR well
- Always add comments to your code
- Follow proper code conventions because writing clean code is important
- Add @jordan-pieces as a reviewer to be assigned to another maintainer or to be reviewed
- Issues will be assigned on a "First Come, First Served" basis
- Once an issue has been assigned, if we don’t receive any reply/response in a week, we will reassign the issue to someone else and remove the assignee
- Do mention (@jordan-pieces) the project maintainer if your PR isn't reviewed within three days

### Pull Request

**1.** Fork the [repository](https://github.com/pieces-app/example-ts) on GitHub.

**2.** Clone the forked repository. Open up the GitBash/Command Line and type:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<YOUR_USER_NAME>/<FORKED_REPO_NAME>.git
```

**3.** Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd <FORKED_REPO_NAME>
```

**4.** Add a reference to the original repository:

```bash
git remote add upstream https://github.com/pieces-app/pieces-os-client-sdk-for-python
```

**5.** See the latest changes to the repo using:

```bash
git remote -v
```

**6.** Create a new branch:

```bash
git checkout -b <YOUR_BRANCH_NAME>
```

**7.** Always take a pull from the upstream repository to your main branch to keep it even with the main project. This will save you from frequent merge conflicts:

```bash
git pull upstream main
```

**8.** You can make the required changes now. Make appropriate commits with proper commit messages.

**9.** Add and then commit your changes:

```bash
git add . && git commit -m "YOUR_COMMIT_MESSAGE"
```

**10.** Push your local branch to the remote repository:

```bash
git push -u origin <YOUR_BRANCH_NAME>
```

**11.** Once you have pushed the changes to your repository, go to your forked repository. Click on the `Compare & pull request` button.

**12.** Give a proper title to your PR and describe the changes you made in the description box. (Note: Sometimes there are PR templates that are to be filled in as instructed.)


**13.** Open a pull request by clicking the `Create pull request` button.

`Voila, you have made your first contribution to this project`

## Issue

**Issues can be used to keep track of bugs, enhancements, or other requests. Creating an issue to let the project maintainers know about the changes you are planning to make before raising a PR is a good open-source practice.**
