# WorkstreamSuggestions

This is a list of the materials used in the workstream suggestions.  The feed will return a list of individual material that will be required to be fetched and re-referenced.(the materials that is.)  Considering if we want to have all the materaials just being referenced( ie ReferencedWebsite/ReferencedWorkstreamSummary/...xyz) && rebuilt
